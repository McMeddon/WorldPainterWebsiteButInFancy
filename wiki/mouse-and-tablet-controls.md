### Tablet

WorldPainter is able to use a tablet, allowing for more direct and detailed control. It supports the following tablet features:

| **Feature** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stylus      | Apply the current tool/layer/terrain type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Eraser      | Apply the inverse of the current tool (when applicable), remove layer, or reset terrain type to height-dependent default terrain type                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Pressure    | If your tablet supports pressure sensitivity, it will control the intensity with which the current operation is applied, relative to the intensity selected with the slider. In other words, if the slider is set to 50%, full pressure will result in 50% intensity, if it is set to 100%, full pressure will result in full intensity. |
| Pen buttons | The first and second pen buttons will increase or decrease the brush size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
